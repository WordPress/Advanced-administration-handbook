# Code of Conduct

This project falls under the WordPress open source project, and follows [WordPress Etiquette](https://wordpress.org/about/etiquette/):

In the WordPress open source project, we realize that our biggest asset is the community that we foster. The project, as a whole, follows these basic philosophical principles from [The Cathedral and The Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/).

- Contributions to the WordPress open source project are for the benefit of the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as a contributor should be made with the best interests of the community in mind.
- Participation in the WordPress open source project is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status, or any other criteria.
- The WordPress open source project is a volunteer-run community. Even in cases where contributors are sponsored by companies, that time is donated for the benefit of the entire open source community.
- Any member of the community can donate their time and contribute to the project in any form including design, code, documentation, community building, etc. For more information, go to [make.wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/).
- The WordPress open source community cares about diversity. We strive to maintain a welcoming environment where everyone can feel included by keeping communication free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and unwelcoming behavior.

The team involved will be proactive in mitigating any breach of this.
