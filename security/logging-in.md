# Your password
## Password recovery

If you forget your WordPress password, use the **Lost your password?** link on the login screen.
WordPress will email a password reset link to the address associated with your account.

### Best practices
- Keep your account email address up to date.
- Use a strong, unique password after resetting.
- Avoid sharing login credentials.

For more details, refer to the official WordPress password recovery documentation.

Creating an extension [of this post about resetting your password](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/resetting-your-password/), but placing all technical details here.

[See this issue on github on sections to take over](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/79) with the following note:
- promote WP CLI above the other options, for being the safest.
