# Using Your Browser to Diagnose JavaScript Errors

Interactive functionality in WordPress often relies on JavaScript. If you encounter broken menus, metaboxes that won‚Äôt drag, or buttons that don‚Äôt work (such as **Add Media**), these may be caused by JavaScript errors or conflicts.

This guide explains how to use your browser to diagnose JavaScript issues so you can provide better information when requesting support.

## Step 1: Try Another Browser {#try-another-browser}

Different browsers sometimes handle JavaScript differently. Test your site in at least two browsers:

- **If the issue only occurs in one browser** ‚Üí it may be browser‚Äëspecific (e.g., an extension conflict).  
- **If the issue occurs in all browsers** ‚Üí it is likely a JavaScript or plugin/theme error.

üëâ Note: Browser extensions (ad blockers, privacy tools) can sometimes interfere with JavaScript. Try disabling extensions or using a private/incognito window to rule this out.

Record which browsers show the error; include this information in your support request.

## Step 2: Enable SCRIPT_DEBUG {#enable-script-debug}

WordPress uses minified JavaScript by default. Enabling `SCRIPT_DEBUG` forces WordPress to load the full, uncompressed versions, which makes errors easier to trace.

1. Open `wp-config.php`.  
2. Add this line **before** ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all, stop editing! Happy publishing‚Äù:  

```php
define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
```

3. Reload your site and check if the error still occurs.

- **If the issue is fixed** ‚Üí turn off `SCRIPT_DEBUG` again and report this detail in your support request.  
- **If the issue persists** ‚Üí continue to Step 3.

## Step 3: Open Browser Developer Tools {#open-devtools}

Every modern browser includes Developer Tools. Open them and switch to the **Console** tab.

- **Chrome / Edge / Opera**: Press **F12** (or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`) ‚Üí select the **Console** tab.  
- **Firefox**: Press **F12** (or `Ctrl+Shift+K` / `Cmd+Option+K`) ‚Üí **Console** tab.  
- **Safari**: First enable the Develop menu: `Safari ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Show Develop menu`. Then open **Develop ‚Üí Show JavaScript Console**.

## Step 4: Identify the Error {#identify-error}

Errors will appear in the Console. A typical error message might look like:

Tips:
- Copy the **full error message and stack trace** (not just the line number).  
- If no errors appear, reload the page ‚Äî some only occur on load.  
- Note the **file name and line number** of the error (e.g., `jquery.js:2`).  

---

## Step 5: Report the Issue {#report}

When requesting help, provide as much detail as possible. Go to the [WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/) or the plugin/theme‚Äôs dedicated forum:  
- Plugins: `https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/PLUGINNAME`  
- Themes: `https://wordpress.org/support/theme/THEMENAME`  

Include the following information:  
- Browsers where the error occurs  
- Whether enabling `SCRIPT_DEBUG` changed the behavior  
- The full JavaScript error message (including stack trace)  
- File name and line number where the error occurred  
- Context ‚Äî what action triggered the error  
- A link to the affected page, if possible

## Summary {#summary}
By confirming the issue across browsers, enabling `SCRIPT_DEBUG`, and checking the browser console, you can quickly diagnose JavaScript errors. Sharing this information in support requests makes it much easier for volunteers and developers to help resolve your problem.
