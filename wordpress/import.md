# Importing Content

Using the WordPress Import tool, you can import content into your site from another WordPress site, or from another publishing system.

You can find many of the importers described here under [Tools](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/#tools-managing-your-blog) -> [Import](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tools-import-screen/) in the left nav of the WordPress [Administration Screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/).

You can import content from publishing systems beyond those listed on the Administration Screen. Procedures differ for each system, so use the procedures and plugins listed below as necessary. If you're new to WordPress, review the [WordPress Features](https://wordpress.org/about/features/) and [Working with WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Working%20with%20WordPress) pages to get started.

If you run into problems, search the [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/) for a solution, or try the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-work-with-wordpress/).

## Before Importing

If the file you're importing is too large, your server may run out of memory when you import it. If this happens, you'll see an error like "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted."

If you have sufficient permissions on the server, you can edit the `php.ini` file to increase the available memory. Alternatively, you could ask your hosting provider to do this. Otherwise, you can edit your import file and save it as several smaller files, then import each one.

If your import process fails, it still may create some content. When you resolve the error and try again, you may create duplicate data. Review your site after a failed import and remove records as necessary to avoid this.
