# Network Admin Settings Screen

The **Network Admin Settings** is where a network admin sets and changes settings for the network as a whole. The first site is the main site in the network and network settings are pulled from that original siteâ€™s options.

## Upload Settings

**Site upload space**

Limit total size of files uploaded to [ 50 ] MB.

**Upload file types**

Default is `jpg jpeg png gif mp3 mov avi wmv midi mid pdf m2ts`.

Note: Adding arbitrary file types will not work unless a corresponding function is also hooked to [upload_mimes](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/upload_mimes/) filter. See the `wp_get_mime_types` function in [wp-includes/functions.php](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/functions.php) for the current default set of supported mime-types / file extensions. Adding mime types in the 'upload file types' field not listed in the default set will **NOT** work unless you've added them using the [upload_mimes](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/upload_mimes/) filter! Uploading files with mime types not supported (without adding them using the filter) will fail with the message "Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons".

**Max upload file size**

Default is [ 1500 ] KB.

## Language Settings

Default is English.

## Menu Settings

**Enable administration menus**

* Plugins

On WordPress Multisite the default setting for plugins is disabled. This means your users won't have access to the plugin admin panel inside their dashboard unless you first enable access to plugins network wide.
